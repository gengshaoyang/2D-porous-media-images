# 2D-porous-media-perm-images
This respository aims to predict the porous media permeability using transfer learning based on Swin transformer architecture.
## Data
The data includes 1000 2D porous media images and their corresponding permeabilities. In our dataset, the permeability of porous media ranges from 90.9 to 2651.7 mD, and
porosity ranges from 0.24 to 0.52.
