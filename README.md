# 2D-porous-media-perm-images
This respository aims to predict the porous media permeability from 2D porous media image using transfer learning based on Swin transformer architecture.
## Data
The data includes three datasets. The first includes 1000 2D porous media images and their corresponding permeabilities. In first dataset, the permeability of porous media ranges from 90.9 to 2651.7 mD, and
porosity ranges from 0.24 to 0.52. The second includes 670 2D noisy porous media images and their corresponding permeabilities, which is generented by Quartet Structure Generation Set (QSGS) method. The third includes 200 rock porous media images from real rock thin sections.
